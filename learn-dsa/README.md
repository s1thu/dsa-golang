# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Go (Golang) for learning and practice purposes.

## 📚 About

This repository contains my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms using Go. Each implementation includes explanations and examples to help understand the concepts.

## 🗂️ Contents

### Data Structures

- **Heap**
  - [Max Heap](./heap/maxHeap/) - Implementation of max heap with insert and heapify operations

### Algorithms
